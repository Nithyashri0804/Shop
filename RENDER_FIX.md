# Fix for ES Module Error

## Problem Fixed:
The error was because Render was trying to run `node api/index.js` but your package.json has `"type": "module"` which causes ES module issues.

## Solution:
Changed the start command to use `node server.js` which is a proper CommonJS file.

## Update Your Render Service:
1. Go to your Render web service settings
2. Change the **Start Command** from `node api/index.js` to `node server.js`
3. Save and redeploy

OR redeploy with the updated render.yaml file:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix ES module error - use server.js"
git push origin main
```

The deployment will now work correctly with `node server.js` as the start command.
