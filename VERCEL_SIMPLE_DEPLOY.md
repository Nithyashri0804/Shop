# Simplified Vercel Deployment

## Issue with Complex Build
The build is timing out due to the large number of dependencies. Let me create a simpler deployment approach.

## Quick Fix Steps:

1. **Remove the complex build command** from vercel.json
2. **Add a health check endpoint** to test the deployment
3. **Use the serverless function approach** without requiring full build

## Deploy with these changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Simplify Vercel deployment - remove complex build"
git push origin main
```

## Environment Variables (still needed):
- `NODE_ENV` = `production`
- `DATABASE_URL` = (your Neon connection string)
- `JWT_SECRET` = (your JWT secret)
- All other business variables from your .env file

## Test the deployment:
Once deployed, test: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health`

This should return: `{"status": "ok", "timestamp": "...", "message": "AS Shreads API is running"}`

If this works, the main app should also work at the root URL.
