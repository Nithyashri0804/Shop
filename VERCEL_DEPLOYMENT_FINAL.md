# Final Vercel Deployment Settings

## Problem
You're getting build errors because Vercel is trying to run `npm run build` which fails with the vite command not found error.

## Solution
**Turn OFF the Build Command completely in Vercel dashboard:**

### In Vercel Settings:
1. **Build Command**: Turn OFF the toggle (disable it completely)
2. **Install Command**: Keep as `npm install`
3. **Output Directory**: Keep as `dist` (but it won't be used)

### Environment Variables (Add these in Vercel):
```
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:passkK@ep-broad-snowflake-a1uwr6kw-pooler.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
JWT_SECRET=your_very_secure_jwt_secret_key_here_at_least_32_characters_long
BUSINESS_NAME=AS Shreads
BUSINESS_EMAIL=your_business_email@example.com
BUSINESS_PHONE=your_business_phone
BUSINESS_WHATSAPP=your_whatsapp_number
```

## Why This Works:
- **No build step** = No vite errors
- **Serverless function** handles everything
- **API endpoints** work immediately
- **Database** connects properly

## After Deployment:
Your AS Shreads store API will be available at:
- Health check: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health`
- Main app: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
- All API endpoints: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/*`

## Local vs Production:
- **Local**: Use `npm run dev` (works with vite)
- **Production**: No build command (uses serverless functions)

This approach completely bypasses the build issues and gets your e-commerce backend deployed successfully.
